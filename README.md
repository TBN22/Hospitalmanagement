# Hospital-Management-System
This is a database management system project written in SQL.

Hospital management systems incorporate doctor details, patient details, doctor’s appointments, 
admitted patients, employee and medical records. Doctors are from different specialization. Also,
doctor’s availability and general details will be stored. Patient table will store patient details with 
age, gender, weight and other personal details. Patient table will also store indications of disease.
Doctor’s appointment can be taken by patients if the doctor has free time slot and patient can see 
the doctor on the free slots. Admitted patient table will store a room or ward no along with bed no
and patient details. The rooms or ward will be supervised by one or more doctors and nurses. 
Employee will include the doctors, nurses, cleaners, receptionists, pharmacists etc. Employee table 
will contain employee name, department, salary etc. With these data, we can easily calculate 
financial properties of the hospital. Each patient’s medical records will be stored and can be 
reviewed any time.
